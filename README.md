# The Great War Timeline

A small JavaScript web app that provides information about world war 1 in an interactive manner. This project was made as part of university cousework.

You can download/clone this repo and simply run the index.html in the latest version of Firefox. You may need to run the site through a local host such as XAMPP to run in other browsers.
